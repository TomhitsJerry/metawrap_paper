# MetaWRAP paper manuscript development page
If you are lost and are interested in the metaWRAP sofware itself (a wrapper tool for metagenomic bin analysis), please redirect to [metaWRAP's main page](https://github.com/ursky/metaWRAP).

This repository hosts all the data associated with writing the metaWRAP paper - data files, figure-making scripts, figures, and manuscript drafts. You may find the code, data, and figures in their respective folders, or go to CURRENT_FIGURES to see the most current version. Additionally, POWERPOINTS contain the figures and their figure legends for easy viewing.
