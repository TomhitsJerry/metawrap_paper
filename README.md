# MetaWRAP paper manuscript development page
If you are lost and are interested in the metaWRAP sofware itself (a wrapper tool for metagenomic bin analysis), please redirect to [metaWRAP's main page](https://github.com/ursky/metaWRAP).

This repository hosts all the data associated with writing the metaWRAP paper, found at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/06/277442

Here, you will find the data files, figure-making scripts, figures, and manuscript drafts. You may find the code, data, and figures in their respective folders, or go to `Additional files` and `Main Figures` to view the final reasults. Additionally, you will find the code to repeat the analysis done in this paper by looking at the `running_metawrap_on_cami_data_commands.sh` and `running_metawrap_on_cami_data_commands.sh` files in `DATA_AND_SCRIPTS`.
